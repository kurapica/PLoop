### Changed
- The `__Arguments__` will drop the overload information when the type is sealed to reduce the memory usage.

### Changed
- The anonymous array & hash struct type with only type settings like `struct { Number }` and `struct { [String] = Number }` will be auto sealed and unique, so the system won't generate multi struct types for the same types.
- The `lshift,rshift,band,bor,bnot,bxor` api is added in the `System.Toolset`, they are generated based on the platform.


## [1.6.10] - 2020-08-11 WangXH <kurapica125@outlook.com>

## [1.5.1] - 2019-12-17 WangXH <kurapica125@outlook.com>
### Added
- `USE_THIS_FOR_OBJECT_METHODS` platform setting is added, used to make sure the overload object method can use `this(self, ...)` to call the other implementions of the same method, default false(normall you can call the target method directly like `Method(self, ...)`)
- The `UseThis` method is added to the `__Arguments__` attribtue, so we can use `this` keyword in object method like `__Arguments__{...}:UseThis()`

## [1.4.5] - 2019-11-27 WangXH <kurapica125@outlook.com>
### Added
- `GetSubTypes` Method is added to `System.Class` and `System.Interface`, will return an iterator to get all sub types directly extend or inherit the target interface or class.

- Fix the System.Web.__Form__ can't validate single value for array types.
- Send the Json data in an inner request will just return the json data to where the `context:ProcessInnerRequest(...)` is called, the system won't try to serialize and output it.
- The inner request will use the raw request's http method if not specific, also will use the raw request's querystring or form if not specific.
- The System.Web.ParseString will also convert the Lua table(object) values to json format string, so we can use the lua table in the template directly.
