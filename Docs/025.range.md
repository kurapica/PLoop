System.Collections.Range
====

The range object is used to represent the range of values like from 1 to 100 by step 2.

So we can declare a range object like 

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    r = Range(1, 100, 2)

    print(r)  -- [1, 99, 2]

    print(r:Sum()) -- 2500

    print(r[30])   -- 59

    for i, v in r:GetIterator() do end
end)
```

The range object extend `IIndexedList`, so we can access it's elments by index without really store those values.

We can get iterator from it, also use all methods provided by the interface like `Map`, `Filter` and etc.


Union
====

Besides the feature of list, the ranges are sets, so we can use set operations on them. 

For two given sets A and B, A ∪ B (read as A union B) is the set of distinct elements that belong to set A and set B or both.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    print(Range(1, 5) + Range(3, 7)) --  [1, 7, 1]
    print(Range(1, 3) + Range(5, 7) + Range(10, 11)) -- [1, 3, 1] .. [5, 7, 1] .. [10, 11, 1]
end)
```

So we can use `+` to combine two ranges into one, the values in one range can be discontinuous.


Intersection
====

For two given sets A and B, A ∩ B (read as A intersection B) is the set of common elements that belong to set A and B. 

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    print(Range(1, 5) * Range(3, 7)) --  [3, 5, 1]
    print(Range(1, 3) * Range(5, 7)) -- [5, 3, 1]
end)
```

For the next result, since stop is less than start, so it's count is 0, we can't get any element from it.


Difference between sets/Relative Complement
====

Relative complement is a term used to describe the set of elements contained in a given set that are not elements of another specified set.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    print(Range(1, 5) - Range(3, 7)) -- [1, 2, 1]
    print(Range(1, 3) - Range(5, 7)) -- [1, 3, 1]
end)
```
