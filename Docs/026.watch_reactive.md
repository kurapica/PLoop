# Watch & Reactive

Besides the common features of the Rx, the `System.Reactive` Lib also provide `reactive & watch` system to simple the usages, so we can use them like common lua tables, and binding reactive operations by function and let the system do the subscriptions automatically.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    -- Decalre a reactive object with init data
    data = reactive {
        name = "Ann",
        info = {
            age = 23
        }
    }

    -- The watch will auto subscribe the data.info.age
    age = watch(function(_ENV) return data.info.age end)

    -- [Info]Dump-->23
    age:Dump()

    -- [Info]Dump-->40
    data.info.age = 40

    -- Error: the age must be number, got string
    data.info.age = "hi"
end)
```

The reactive keyword will create the reactive object with the init table's data structure. Also the value type is infered by the init value for validation.

And the watch keyword will create an environment to do auto subscription based on the function, and return an observable subject for further usages.


## reactive

The `reactive` keyword is provided by `System.Reactive` framework used to create observable data source easily. There are several ways to use it.


### System.Reactive.ReactiveValue

if we pass `number`, `string`, `boolean` value to `reactive`, we'll get a ReactiveValue object.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    data = reactive(1000)
    data:Dump()      -- [Info]Dump-->1000
    data.Value = 200 -- [Info]Dump-->200
    print(data + 20) -- 220
end)
```

The reactive value can be used like common values, but since meta-methods like `__lt` are not supported in Lua 5.1, you can't use several operations, but you always can access the raw value from `Value` property.

Classes marked as value types like `Date` will also be converted to the ReactiveValue.


### System.Reactive & System.Reactive.ReactiveField

### For raw table without struct

Like the first example, if we apply reactive on a raw tabel without template parameter, it'll be converted based on the data structure.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    -- Decalre a reactive object with init data
    data = reactive {
        name = "Ann",
        info = {
            age = 23
        }
    }

    -- System.Reactive
    print(getmetatable(data))

    -- System.Reactive
    print(getmetatable(data.info))

    -- System.Reactive.ReactiveValue_System_String_D23BF4C7 == System.Reactive.ReactiveValue[System.String]
    print(getmetatable(data.name))

    data.score = 30

    -- System.Reactive.ReactiveValue_System_Number_1E513150 == System.Reactive.ReactiveValue[System.Number]
    print(getmetatable(data.score))

    -- [Info]Score-->30
    data.score:Dump("Score")

    -- [Info]Score-->40
    data.score = 40

    data.another = { info = 3 }

    -- System.Reactive
    print(getmetatable(data.another))

    -- false    the another can't be set
    print(pcall(function() data.another = {} end))

    b = Subject()
    data.score = b

    -- [Info]Score-->100
    b:OnNext(100)
end)
```

All hash table will be converted to System.Reactive object, and the scalar value will be converted to System.Reactive.ReactiveValue with the value type as template parameter.

Also we can assign new value to it, they'll be converted to reactive object.

We can assign new value to field of reactive value, but the field of reactive is readonly.

We also can assign observable object to the reactive value, they'll subscribe it for the data pushing.


#### For raw table with struct

The reactive keyword can use data type as template parameter to create reactive object based on the given type.

Normally the type should be a member struct.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    struct "Loc" {
        point = {
            x = Number,
            y = Number
        },
        z = Number
    }

    -- Loc as reactive template parameter
    data = reactive[Loc]{
        point = {
            x = 1,
            y = 2,
        },
        z = 2
    }
    data:Dump()

    -- System.Reactive_Anonymous_233AB55C == System.Reactive.Reactive[Loc]
    print(getmetatable(data.point))

    -- System.Reactive.ReactiveField_System_Number_B1DA81C1 == System.Reactive.ReactiveField[Systen.Number]
    print(getmetatable(data.point.x))

    -- [Info]Dump-->point, x, 100
    data.point.x = 100

    -- [Info]Dump-->point, table: 013A68F0
    data.point = { x = 5, y = 5 }

    -- [Info]Dump-->z, 102
    data.z = data.z + 100

    -- false    The another can't be written
    print(pcall(function() data.another = {} end))
end)
```

It looks just like use reactive without given type, but if check the field's type, they are very different.

Since the fields are given with types, those fields are fixed, so for a number field, the type is `System.ReactiveField` not `System.ReactiveValue`, means they are owned by the reactive object, besides that, they works the same, so we can use it direclty in operations like `+`.

Also we don't need use `data.z.Value = 100` to assign the new value like `System.ReactiveValue`, we can simple it to `data.z = 100`.

And for a field with table value, we can replace `data.point` by another value of the given type, since the system know the data structure won't change, it's allowed, but if we use reactive without given type, the assignment is blocked, since we don't know the new value have the same data structure.

And since the fields are defined in the struct type, no new field can be added to the reactive objects.

We also can remove the struct type definition like

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    -- The struct definition as template parameter
    data = reactive[
        {
            point = {
                x = Number,
                y = Number
            },
            z = Number
        }
    ]{
        point = {
            x = 1,
            y = 2,
        },
        z = 2
    }

    data:Dump()
    data.point.x = 100   -- [Info]Dump-->point, x, 100
    data.point = { x = 5, y = 5 } -- [Info]Dump-->point, table: 013A68F0
    data.z = 100         -- [Info]Dump-->z, 100
end)
```

Since we declare the point field also a struct, the `data.point` is a `Reactive` object, we can use it standalone.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    -- The struct definition as template parameter
    data = reactive[
        {
            point = {
                x = Number,
                y = Number
            },
            z = Number
        }
    ]{
        point = {
            x = 1,
            y = 2,
        },
        z = 2
    }

    data:Dump("Data")
    point = data.point
    point:Dump("Point")

    -- [Info]Data-->point, x, 100
    -- [Info]Point-->x, 100
    point.x = 100

    -- replace the point won't affect the previous point object
    -- [Info]Data-->point, table: 01450098
    data.point = { x = 3, y = 4 }

    -- the data won't receive the point changes
    -- [Info]Point-->y, 50
    point.y = 50

    -- 4
    print(data.point.y)
end)
```


#### For common classes

For non-dict, non-list, non-value type classes, use `reactive` on its object will also convert it to a `Reactive` object. The properties of the object will also be converted when access.

It works like the struct type, but with method supports.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    class "Person" {
        Name = String,
        Age = Number,
        Parents = struct { Person },

        Greets = function(self)
            print("I have " .. #self.Parents .. " parents")
        end
    }

    -- Since the object provide the class type, we don't need give it the reactive keyword
    Ann = reactive(Person{ Name = "Ann", Age = 24 })
    Ann:Dump()

    -- [Info]Dump-->Parents, table: 014189D8
    Ann.Parents = { Person{ Name = "Ben", Age = 44 } }

    -- Methods can be called
    -- I have 1 parents
    Ann:Greets()

    -- [Info]Dump-->Age, 25
    Ann.Age = 25

    -- [Info]Dump-->Parents, 1, Age, 45
    Ann.Parents[1].Age = 45

    Ben = Ann.Parents[1]

    -- [Info]Dump-->Parents, 1, table: 014058D0
    Ann.Parents[1] = Person{ Name = "Kin", Age = 42 }

    -- no message since Ben is not trackable by Ann
    Ben.Age = 46
end)
```

We also can assign observable or reactivable value to the reactive fields, if the value is `ReactiveValue` or `ReactiveField`, it's current value will be used, if the value is `IObservable`, then the reactive field will subscribe it.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    class "Person" {
        Name = String,
        Age = Number,
        Parents = struct { Person }
    }

    Ann = reactive(Person{ Name = "Ann", Age = 24 })
    Ben = reactive(Person{ Name = "Ben", Age = 21 })

    -- [Info]Age-->24
    Ann.Age:Dump("Age")

    -- [Info]Age-->21
    Ann.Age = Ben.Age

    -- nothing
    Ben.Age = 25

    -- The observable
    subject = BehaviorSubject(12)

    -- [Info]Age-->12
    Ann.Age = subject

    -- [Info]Age-->15
    subject:OnNext(15)

    -- [Info]Age-->29
    subject:OnNext(29)
end)
```


### System.Reactive.ReactiveDictionary

For common lua hash tables with dict struct type as the template parameter or dictionary objects, the `reactive` will return a ReactiveDictionary object, it can be used as normal table for access, and we'll receive the changes of its field.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    -- Use dict struct type as template
    data = reactive[struct{ [String] = Number }]
    {
        x = 1,
        y = 2
    }

    print(getmetatable(data))

    data:Dump()

    -- [Info]Dump-->x, 3
    data.x = 3

    -- false   Usage: System.Reactive.ReactiveDictionary_Anonymous_86DB1801:__newindex(System.String, [System.Number]) - the 2nd argument must be number, got string
    print(pcall(function() data.x = "hi" end))

    -- nil, the value from the dictionary won't be converted to reactive
    print(getmetatable(data.y))
end)
```

The reactive dictionary can track its field changes, but since those fields are not fixed, they won't be converted to reactive value or reactive field, all field access is raw values.

We can use `data.Value` to read/write the raw table of the ReactiveDictionary.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    data = reactive[struct{ [String] = Number }]{
        x = 1,
        y = 2
    }

    data:Dump("Origin")

    -- [Info]Origin-->x, 10
    data.x = 10

    -- nil means the whole value changed
    -- [Info]Origin-->nil
    data.Value = { z = 1, y = 2 }
    data:Dump("New")

    -- [Info]Origin-->y, 20
    -- [Info]New-->y, 20
    data.y = 20
end)
```


#### System.Reactive.ReactiveList

For list objects or array table without metatable, the system will use `ReactiveList` object, it has all methods like `List`.

Normally values changes in the list can trigger the message like `index, value, ...`, but since operations like `Shift` will change all indexes of the elements, if we publish all index changes that'll be too much function calls.

So the system will use three type values instead of the index:

1. number - the index of the element that be replaced or content changed, and the element only take one slot in the list.

2. {number, number, ...} -  the indexes of the element that be replaced or content changed, and the element take multi slot in the list.

3. Range(from, to) - the operatins like `Pop`, `Push`, `Shift`, `Unshift`, `Splice`, `Remove`, `Insert`, `Clear` and others all will change multi elements's indexes, but those indexes must be in a range, so we use Range object to track them. There will be no value follow the range objects, since the changes are too more to be tracked.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    list = reactive{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }

    list:Dump()

    -- means changed from 1 to 10 with step 1
    -- [Info]Dump-->[1, 10, 1]
    list:Shift()

    -- 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
    print(list:Join(","))

    -- [Info]Dump-->[4, 12, 1]
    list:Splice(4, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)

    -- 2,3,4,11,12,13,14,15,7,8,9,10
    print(list:Join(","))

    -- [Info]Dump-->5, 20
    list[5] = 20
end)
```

An example that one element take more slots in the list.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    System.Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    class "Person" {
        Name = String,
        Age = Number,
        Father = Person
    }

    list = reactive
    {
        Person{ Name = "Ann", Age = 24 },
        Person{ Name = "Ben", Age = 25 },
        Person{ Name = "Kin", Age = 30 }
    }

    list:Dump()

    -- [Info]Dump-->4, table: 013D5AD8
    list:Insert(list[2])

    -- [Info]Dump-->{2,4}, Age, 28
    list[2].Age = 28
end)
```

It's not easy to handle the range value when list changes, but in most case we don't really check the changes. Also with the with system, we can leave the change details out of the scope.


## watch

The `watch` is the keyword provided by the `System.Reactive` that will auto calculate the given function's result based on data changes. It will return a `System.Reactive.Watch` object, which inherit the `BehaviorSubject`.

The given function will be processed immediality in a private environment, that can be used to track what the function accessed, and do the subscriptions automatically.

For Lua 5.2 and above, it's better to use `_ENV` as the given function's parameter.

As a complex example:

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    switcher = reactive(false)
    data = reactive{
        on = "Go",
        off = "Stop"
    }

    -- Stop
    watch(function(_ENV)
        if switcher then
            print(data.on)
        else
            print(data.off)
        end
    end)

    -- Go
    switcher.Value = true

    -- Continue
    data.on = "Continue"
end)
```

When the function is first processed, the switcher will be subscribed and since it's value is `false`, the `data.off` will be subscribed.

When change the switcher to `true`, the function will be processed and will access the `data.on`, now it's subscribed. So with the function processing, all observable will be subscribed.


### Watch With Special Observables

Since `watch` can only detect the global variable access, it'll fail when we use local variables.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    local switcher = reactive(false)
    local data = reactive{
        on = "Go",
        off = "Stop"
    }

    -- Since the switcher is a real object, it'll be treated as true
    -- Go
    watch(function(_ENV)
        if switcher then
            print(data.on)
        else
            print(data.off)
        end
    end)

    -- Nothing happens
    switcher.Value = true
    data.on = "Continue"
end)
```

To make it works, we can do it like

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    local switcher = reactive(false)
    local data = reactive{
        on = "Go",
        off = "Stop"
    }

    -- Stop
    watch({
        rswitcher = switcher,
        rdata = data
    }, function(_ENV)
        if rswitcher then
            print(rdata.on)
        else
            print(rdata.off)
        end
    end)

    -- Go
    switcher.Value = true

    -- Continue
    data.on = "Continue"
end)
```

If we provides those observable sources from other place, we can use the table to organize them.

And if we provide an observable(include reactive objects) instead of a raw table, the watch will only track the observable, and call the given function with the observable value that can be used directly.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    switcher = reactive(false)
    data = reactive{
        on = "Go",
        off = "Stop"
    }

    -- Stop
    watch(switcher,
        function(_ENV, switcher)
            if switcher then
                print(data.on)
            else
                print(data.off)
            end
        end
    )

    -- Go
    switcher.Value = true

    -- Not trigger
    data.on = "Continue"
end)
```


### Custom environment

Since the watch system was done with environment system, we also can specific the environment.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    Ann = reactive{
        name = "Ann",
        born = 2000,
    }

    -- [Info]Age-->26
    watch(function(_ENV)
        return year - Ann.born + 1
    end, { year = 2025 }):Dump("Age")

    -- [Info]Age-->21
    Ann.born = 2005

    -- [Info]Age-->16
    Ann.born = 2010
end)
```

The init table `{ year = 2025 }` will be converted to an environment object with `_ENV` as its parent. So in the watch function we can access the year directly, and get the `Ann` object from it's parent - the `_ENV`.



### Observable Watch

Since the `watch` will return a Watch object which inherit `BehaviorSubject`, it's also observable.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    switcher = reactive(false)
    data = reactive{
        on = "Go",
        off = "Stop"
    }

    -- need declare the label as string field
    info = reactive[{ label = String }]{}

    -- so info.label is a reactive field object can track the observable data
    info.label = watch(function(_ENV) return switcher and data.on or data.off end)

    -- Can continue watch the info
    watch(function(_ENV) print("Info is " .. info.label) end) -- Info is Stop

    switcher.Value = true -- Info is Go
    data.on = "Continue"  -- Info is Continue
end)
```

With the `reactive` and `watch`, we can create complex observable datas just like using common lua table.


### Dispose the Watch

The Watch object can be disposed, all its subscriptions will be canceled.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    data = reactive(100)

    local w = watch(function() print(("%d^2 = %d"):format(data, data^2)) end) -- 100^2 = 10000

    data.Value = 20 -- 20^2 = 400

    w:Dispose()

    data.Value = 100 -- nothing happens
end)
```


### Write data in the Watch

If write the data in the watch, the data part will be made writable, that means the watch won't track its changes.

```lua
require "PLoop" (function(_ENV)
    Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)

    data = reactive{
        x = 3,
        y = 4,
        z = 0,
    }

    watch(function(_ENV)
        data.z = math.sqrt(data.x ^2 + data.y ^ 2)
    end)

    -- [Info]Z-->5
    data.z:Dump("Z")

    -- [Info]Z-->300.02666548159
    data.x = 300

    -- [Info]Z-->500
    data.y = 400

    -- [Info]Z-->100
    data.z = 100
end)
```

Since the watch will write the `data.z`, when we change z to 100, it won't trigger the watch to assign the calc value to it.
