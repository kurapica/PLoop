# System.Net.MQTT

The MQTT Lib support MQTT v3.1(3), v3.1.1(4) and v5.0(5), it works with the [LuaSocket][].
With the [NgxLua][] it also support building MQTT services within the [OpenResty][].


## Start with an example with MQTT server and client
----

This example require [LuaSocket][] to be run.

```lua
--- MQTT services
-- MQTT lib is standalone, so should be required first
require "PLoop.System.Net.MQTT"

PLoop(function(_ENV)
    import "System.Net"
    import "System.Net.MQTT"

    -- with trace logger, the details will be print out, also you can turn it to
    -- Logger.LogLevel.Info for simple
    Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)
    Logger.Default.LogLevel = Logger.LogLevel.Trace

    -- System.Net.MQTT.Server provide the mqtt services
    -- Use `with` pattern to make sure it can be closed without error
    -- Don't need set the mqtt protocol level, since the server can handle
    -- all three protocol levels
    with(Server{ ReceiveTimeout = 1, Port = 3000 })(function(server)
        while true do
            -- This is a simple example, so only works for one client
            -- Get the client and process with operations with the client
            with(server:GetClient())(function(client)
                local topic

                -- The OnTopicSubscribed event can be used to handle the subscribed topic
                -- The client can use a message publisher to handle the pub/sub jobs automatically
                -- But we may need handle it for special usages
                function client:OnTopicSubscribed(t)
                    print("OnTopicSubscribed", t)
                    topic           = t
                end

                -- The OnMessageReceived event fired when the client publish a message to the server
                function client:OnMessageReceived(topic, payload)
                    print("[PAYLOAD]", payload)
                end

                -- This is the main logic, the Process is a loop until the connection is closed
                -- It'll receive the packete from the client and answer it automatically, it'll also
                -- check the subscribed topic and send the published message of the topic to the client
                --
                -- You can also create your own Process logic, we'll see it later
                client:Process()
            end, function(err)
                print("The client is closed:", tostring(err))
            end)
        end
    end, function(err)
        print(err)
    end)
end)
```

```lua
-- MQTT Client
require "PLoop.System.Net.MQTT"

PLoop(function(_ENV)
    import "System.Net"
    import "System.Net.MQTT"

    Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)
    Logger.Default.LogLevel = Logger.LogLevel.Trace

    -- Use MQTT v3.1.1 version
    local client = Client{ Address  = "127.0.0.1",  ProtocolLevel = 4, Port = 3000 }

    local ok, err = pcall(function()
        print("Connecting ...")
        if client:Connect() then
            print("Connection established")

            client:Subscribe("/topic")

            for i = 1, 3 do
                print("Sleep 5 sec")

                -- the client.Socket is the System.Net.Socket based on LuaSocket
                -- So we can use it to sleep
                client.Socket:Sleep(5)

                print("Publish message")
                client:Publish("/topic", [[{"station_name":"test","real_data",[{"tag_desc":"liquid","value":"1.350"},{"tag_desc":"pressure","value":"3.600"}]], 1, true)

                -- We can get the next packet and its type through the ParsePacket method
                local ptype, packet = client:ParsePacket()
                if ptype then
                    print(PacketType(ptype), Toolset.tostring(packet))

                    -- The ProcessPacket can handle the packet automatically and send the response to the server
                    -- The Process method of server is done by ParsePacket and ProcessPacket
                    client:ProcessPacket(ptype, packet)
                end
            end

            client:DisConnect()
        end
    end)

    print(err)
end)
```


The MQTT is a big topic to be discussed, in this chapter, we'll cover the normal usages.


## System.Net.MQTT.Client

This is the basic mqtt client class, it provide the basic MQTT operations no matter where or which platform you use it.

There are two types of the client:

1. The client used to connect the server, we create that in the previous example like `local client = Client{ Address  = "127.0.0.1",  ProtocolLevel = 4, Port = 3000 }`.

2. The client that returned by the server's Accept method, we get that in previous example like `server:GetClient()`.

Although they all represents the client, they use different methods, and the data transmission is opposite.

In the previous examples, the client-side client used `Subscribe` to subscribe topics, use `Publish` to publish message to server,
and the `ProcessPacket` to handle any packet you don't want handled manually, we'll see the full list later.



## System.Net.MQTT.Server

Unlike the Client, the server class defined in `System.Net.MQTT` is just an implementation based on [LuaSocket][], and normally it's
only used to handle one client at the same time. We already see how to use it in the example.

With [NgxLua][] and [OpenResty][] we can build a full functional MQTT server, but there is no MQTTServer class defined, we only need
use the `NgxLua.Net.MQTT.Client` to handle the MQTT clients. So we won't discuss the server any more.



## MQTT Enums
----

Here are some main enums, there are many other enums could be used but you should check them in [MQTT Core][].

**System.Net.MQTT.ProtocolLevel** - The MQTT Protocol Level for different version

* V3_1      - 3, the MQTT v3.1
* V3_1_1    - 4, The MQTT v3.1.1
* V5_0      - 5, The MQTT v5.0


**System.Net.MQTT.PacketType** - The MQTT packet type


* FORBIDDEN     - 0,  unexpected type
* CONNECT       - 1,  the connection data packet
* CONNACK       - 2,  the connection ack data packete
* PUBLISH       - 3,  the publish message data packet
* PUBACK        - 4,  the publish message ack data packet
* PUBREC        - 5,  the publish message receive data packet
* PUBREL        - 6,  the publish message release data packet
* PUBCOMP       - 7,  the publish message complete data packet
* SUBSCRIBE     - 8,  The topic subscribe data packet
* SUBACK        - 9,  the topic subscribe ack data packet
* UNSUBSCRIBE   - 10, the topic unsubscribe data packet
* UNSUBACK      - 11, the topic unsubscribe ack data packet
* PINGREQ       - 12, the ping request data packet
* PINGRESP      - 13, the ping response data packet
* DISCONNECT    - 14, the disconnect data packete
* AUTH          - 15, The auth data packet, For MQTT v5.0


**System.Net.MQTT.QosLevel** - The message QoS level

* AT_MOST_ONCE  - 0, No ack for the published message
* AT_LEAST_ONCE - 1, Need return ack for the published message
* EXACTLY_ONCE  - 2, Need use PUBREC -> PUBREL -> PUBCOMP to confirm the message


We'll discuss the MQTT protocol by the packet types.


## CONNECT
----

Client-Side Only, used to connect the server. Works like:

```lua
local client        = Client{
    Address         = "127.0.0.1",  -- The server address to be connected
    Port            = 3000,         -- The server port to be connected
    ProtocolLevel   = 4,            -- The MQTT Protocol Level to be used
    ClientID        = "1ACD-67FA",  -- The client id used to identify the client
    UserName        = "tester",     -- The user name if needed
    Password        = "xxxxx",      -- the user password if needed

    KeepConnection  = true,         -- Whether auto send the ping to the server to keep connection, default true
    ReceiveTimeout  = 1,            -- Gets or sets a value that specifies the amount of time after which a synchronous Receive call will time out
    SendTimeout     = 1,            -- Gets or sets a value that specifies the amount of time after which a synchronous Send call will time out
    ConnectTimeout  = 1,            -- Gets or sets a value that specifies the amount of time after which a synchronous Connect call will time out
    MessageReceiveTimeout = 1,      -- Gets or sets a value that specifies the amount of time for the message published after which a synchronous Receive call will time out
    KeepConnection  = true,         -- Whether auto send the ping to the server to keep connection, default true
    KeepAlive       = 60,           -- The keep alive time(in sec), default 1 min
    CleanSession    = false,        -- The clean session flag, if true the session for the client will be clean when it connected, default false
}

client:Connect()
```

So here is a full list properties can be set during client's creation. The Connect method is defined as:

```lua
__Arguments__{ ConnectWill/nil, PropertySet/nil }
function Connect(self, will, properties)
end

-- The will message that should be published when the network connection is subsequently closed
__Sealed__() struct "ConnectWill"        {
    { name = "qos",         type = QosLevel }, -- The QoS level of the will message
    { name = "retain",      type = Boolean },  -- Wether the will message is to be retained when it's published
    { name = "topic",       type = String },   -- The message's topic
    { name = "message",     type = String },   -- The message use in V3.1 and v3.1.1
    { name = "payload",     type = String },   -- The message payload used in v5.0

    { name = "properties",  type = PropertySet }, -- The properties used in v5.0
}

__Sealed__() struct "PropertySet"        {
    [PropertyIdentifier]    = String + Number + struct{ String + Number } + struct { [String] = String }
}
```

The `PropertyIdentifier` is an enum, check the [MQTT Core][] for details. The properties are features bring in by MQTT v5.0,
you should check the [MQTT v5.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html) for more details.



## CONNACK
----

Server-side client only, used to confirm the connection to the client.

```lua
__Arguments__{ ConnectReturnCode/ConnectReturnCode.ACCEPTED, PropertySet/nil }
function ConnectAck(self, returnCode, properties)
end
```

This will send a CONNACK packet to the client, normally there is no need to call this method directly, it'll be
done in the `ProcessPacket`, you only need implemente `Authenticate` method to check if should refuse the connection:

```lua
class "MyClient" (function(_ENV)
    inherit "Systm.Net.MQTT.Client"

    --- Valiate the connection or auth packet for authentication, should return the ConnectReturnCode as result
    -- or true to ack the connection, false to refuse it
    function Authenticate(self, packet)
        local clientID      = packet.clientID
        if not clientID then return false end

        -- A fake func to check if the client can be connected by its id, user name and password
        return isClientPermit(packet.clientID, packet.userName, packet.password)
    end
end)
```

The packet that passed in the Authenticate is **System.Net.MQTT.ConnectPacket**:

```lua
__Sealed__()
struct "ConnectPacket"      {
    { name = "level",       type = ProtocolLevel },
    { name = "cleanSession",type = Boolean },      -- MQTT v3.1.1
    { name = "cleanStart",  type = Boolean },      -- MQTT v5.0
    { name = "keepAlive",   type = Number },
    { name = "will",        type = ConnectWill },
    { name = "properties",  type = PropertySet },

    -- Payload
    { name = "clientID",    type = String },
    { name = "userName",    type = String },
    { name = "password",    type = String },
}
```

Normally we can use its clientID, userName and password for `Authenticate`, the client will handle other fields like
`level`, `cleanSession`, `keepAlive` and `will`, the client can't handle the `properties`, so you can also handle it in the
`Authenticate`.



## PUBLISH
----

Can be used by both server-side and client-side. It will publish the message to the server or client, and return the packet id
for later checking.

```lua
__Arguments__{ NEString, NEString, QosLevel/QosLevel.AT_MOST_ONCE, Boolean/false, PropertySet/nil }
function Publish(self, topic, payload, qos, retain, properties)
end
```

It's already used in the first example, based on the QoS, the server-side and client-side clients will determine how to confirm
the message is received. The client can use  `OnMessageReceived` event to handle the published messages, and leave the confirm
details to `ProcessPacket` methods.

If the QoS is `QosLevel.AT_MOST_ONCE`, there is no need to confirm, so nothing shoud be done. If you need handle the confirm by
youself, check the next packet types.



## PUBACK
----

We can use `PubAck` method for `QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE` level.

```lua
__Arguments__{ Number, ReasonCode/ReasonCode.SUCCESS, PropertySet/nil}
function PubAck(self, packetid, reasonCode, properties)
end
```

There is an unknown packetid, since this is normally handled by the `ProcessPacket` method, the `OnMessageReceived` don't need
the packetid.

If you want handle the published message, you could do it by override the `Process` method:

```lua
import "System.Net.MQTT"

class "ServerSideClient" (function(_ENV)
    inherit "Client"

    -- It's not easy to define a real process method, for simple, we just create the server-side client,
    -- and don't handle the pub/sub part
    function Process(self)
        while self.State ~= ClientState.CLOSED do
            -- Get the next packet from the socket, it could be nil if receive timeout
            local ptype, packet = self:ParsePacket()

            if ptype then
                if ptype == PacketType.PUBLISH then
                    -- handle the confirm based on the QoSLevel
                    if packet.qos == QosLevel.AT_LEAST_ONCE then
                        -- So we have the packetID through the packet
                        self:PubAck(packet.packetID)
                    elseif packet.qos == QosLevel.EXACTLY_ONCE then
                        self:PubRec(packet.packetID)
                    end
                else
                    -- handle other packet type automatically
                    self:ProcessPacket(ptype, packet)
                end
            end
        end
    end
end)
```

Here is the details of the publish packet:

```lua
__Sealed__()
struct "PublishPacket"      {
    { name = "dupFlag",     type = Boolean },       -- whether this is a re-delivery
    { name = "qos",         type = QosLevel },      -- The packet's QoS level
    { name = "retainFlag",  type = Boolean },       -- Whether the server should retain the message
    { name = "topicName",   type = String },        -- The topic name
    { name = "packetID",    type = Number },        -- The packet id
    { name = "payload",     type = String },        -- The message payload
    { name = "properties",  type = PropertySet },   -- The packet properties, V5.0 only
}
```


## PUBREC
----

It's a little complex for `QoSLevel.EXACTLY_ONCE`, when the server (or client it works in both way) receive a published message, it'll
send a PUBREC to notify the client that it has receive the packet, then the client need send back a PUBREL packet to request the server
to release the packet, when the server release it, the server must send a PUBCOMP packet to the client, so the client know this is all
done, it also can release the packet now.

Normally you could leave the whole part to the `ProcessPacket` method, but the system don't really handle the fail condition since it
don't know when you want to re-publish the failed messages.

The client will keep the un-released packet in its `PublishPackets` property, so you can check it and re-publish them like:

```lua
class "MyClient" (function(_ENV)
    inherit "Systm.Net.MQTT.Client"

    -- A new method to check and re-publish the packets
    function RePublishPackets(self)
        -- For simple, the PublishPackets is just a table { [packetID] = packet }
        -- the packet will be cleared when it's PUBACK or PUBCOMP
        for _, packetID in XDictionary(self.PublishPackets).Keys:ToList():Sort():GetIterator() do
            -- Use the RePublish method to re-deliver
            self:RePublish(packetID)
        end
    end
end)
```

You can also use `IsPacketAcked` method to check if a packet can be released:

```lua
function IsPacketAcked(self, packetid)
end
```

If you want handle the PUBREC by yourself, the method is

```lua
__Arguments__{ Number, ReasonCode/ReasonCode.SUCCESS, PropertySet/nil}
function PubRec(self, packetid, reasonCode, properties)
end
```


## PUBREL
----

Send the packet release to the server(client), normally handled by `ProcessPacket`.

```lua
__Arguments__{ Number, ReasonCode/ReasonCode.SUCCESS, PropertySet/nil}
function PubRel(self, packetid, reasonCode, properties)
end
```


## PUBCOMP
----

Send the packet complete to the server(client), normally handled by `ProcessPacket`.

```lua
__Arguments__{ Number, ReasonCode/ReasonCode.SUCCESS, PropertySet/nil}
function PubComp(self, packetid, reasonCode, properties)
end
```



## SUBSCRIBE
----

This is used to subscribe the topic filters, we'll see its usages at the last example.

```lua
__Arguments__{ NEString, QosLevel/nil, PropertySet/nil, TopicFilterOption/nil }
function Subscribe(self, filter, qos, properties, options) end

__Arguments__{ TopicFilters, PropertySet/nil }
function Subscribe(self, topicFilters, properties) end

__Sealed__()
struct "TopicFilterOption"  {
    { name = "retain",      type = Number },
    { name = "rap",         type = Boolean }, -- Retain as Published
    { name = "nolocal",     type = Boolean },
    { name = "qos",         type = Number },
}

__Sealed__()
struct "TopicFilter"        {
    { name = "topicFilter", type = String, require = true },
    { name = "requestedQoS",type = Number },
    { name = "options",     type = TopicFilterOption },
}

__Sealed__()
struct "TopicFilters"       { TopicFilter }
```

The pub/sub is handled by `MessagePublisher` of the server-side client:

```lua
property "MessagePublisher" { type = System.Net.MQTT.IMQTTPublisher }

-- The default process method of the server-side client
__Abstract__() function Process(self)
    while self.State ~= ClientState.CLOSED do
        if self.IsServerSide and self.MessagePublisher then
            -- Check the published message
            local topic, message, qos = self.MessagePublisher:ReceiveMessage()

            if topic and message then
                self:Publish(topic, message, qos)
            end
        end

        local ptype, packet = self:ParsePacket()

        if ptype then
            self:ProcessPacket(ptype, packet)
        end
    end
end
```

So the server-side client will try to receive the message from its message publisher(with receive timeout),
when another client published the message of its subscribed topic, the message publisher will receive that.

And here is the code that handle the subscribe packet in `ProcessPacket`:

```lua
if ptype == PacketType.SUBSCRIBE then
    -- Subscribe the topic filter
    local returnCodes   = {}
    local publisher     = self.MessagePublisher
    local subscribed    = Queue()

    for i, filter in ipairs(packet.topicFilters) do
        local qos       = min(self.MaximumQosLevel, filter.requestedQoS or QosLevel.AT_MOST_ONCE)

        -- Need a message publisher to subscribe topics, orelse failure should be returned
        returnCodes[i]  = publisher and publisher:SubscribeTopic(filter.topicFilter, qos) or SubAckReturnCode.FAILURE

        self.TopicFilters[filter.topicFilter] = returnCodes[i]

        if returnCodes[i] <= SubAckReturnCode.MAX_QOS_2 then
            subscribed:Enqueue(filter.topicFilter, qos)
        end
    end

    -- Send the ack for the subscribe packet
    self:SubAck(packet.packetID, returnCodes)

    while subscribed.Count > 0 do
        -- Fire the OnTopicSubscribed event on the client
        -- which used in the first example
        OnTopicSubscribed(self, subscribed:Dequeue(2))
    end
end
```

So the PUB/SUB pattern is all handled by the message publisher. So here is the details.

* The publish-subscribe message pattern is defined in [Message.lua](../System/Message.lua). The **System.Message.IPublisher**
    is the interface that represents the publish–subscribe messaging pattern. So any message publisher should implemente those
    methods: `SubscribeTopic`, `UnsubscribeTopic`, `PublishMessage`, `ReceiveMessage`.

* The **System.Message.MessagePublisher** is a single thread publisher only for test, and since it only support the topic filter
    like lua regex pattern, it won't works for the MQTT topic filter.

* The interface for MQTT message publisher is defined as [System.Net.MQTT.IMQTTPublisher](../System/Net/MQTT/MessagePublisher.lua),
    the interface has final implementation for those four methods, it'll done the common part like convert the topic filter to
    lua pattern, manage the topic filters and raise the events, so the class extend it can focus on the save/distrubute message logics.

* There is a **System.Net.MQTT.FakeMQTTPublisher** that used to do nothing but allow the topic can be subscribed/unsubscribed.
    there is some scenario we need know which topic the client subscribed, but don't need to handle it with the full PUB/SUB pattern.
    this is a useful fake publisher to do that, you still can use the client's OnTopicSubscribed event to handle the subscribed topics.

* Also there is a **System.Net.MQTT.MQTTPublisher** that can be used on single-thread platform for test.

* For a real productable message publisher, you should check [NgxLua][], it provide **NgxLua.Net.MQTT.RedisMQTTPublisher** that
    use the redis to publish and distribute topic messages, we'll see the usages at the last example.



## SUBACK
----

This is the ack for subscribe, normally you should leave it to `ProcessPacket` unless you want handle the subscribe topic by yourself.

```lua
__Arguments__{ Number, SubAckReturnCode/nil, PropertySet/nil }
function SubAck(self, packetid, returncode, properties)
end
```



## UNSUBSCRIBE
----

This is used by client-side client to unsubscribe topics

```lua
__Arguments__{ NEString, PropertySet/nil }
function Unsubscribe(self, filter, properties)
end

__Arguments__{ TopicFilters, PropertySet/nil }
function Unsubscribe(self, topicFilters, properties)
end
```


## UNSUBACK
----

The unsubscribe ack:

```lua
__Arguments__{ Number, ReasonCode/nil, PropertySet/nil }
function UnsubAck(self, packetid, returncode, properties)
end

__Arguments__{ Number, struct { ReasonCode }, PropertySet/nil }
function UnsubAck(self, packetid, returncodes, properties)
end
```



## PINGREQ
----

The PINGREQ is used to keep connection alive and checking. It has no arguments.

```lua
function PingReq(self)
end
```



## PINGRESP
----

This is a response for the PINGREQ, so the connetion will be keep alive.

```lua
function PingResp(self)
end
```



## DISCONNECT
----

Client-side only, used to close the connection:

```lua
__Arguments__{ ReasonCode/nil, PropertySet/nil }
function DisConnect(self, reason, properties)
end
```

Also you can close the client by server-side with another method, so it's here that the will message of
the client be published.

```lua
function CloseClient(self)
end
```



## AUTH
----

AUTH is added in MQTT v5.0, used for complex authenticate between client and server, it's behavior is customed
so the client class only provide the method to send packet, all should be done in the `Authenticate` methods by
yourselves.

```lua
__Arguments__{ ReasonCode/ReasonCode.SUCCESS, PropertySet/nil }
function Auth(self, reasonCode, properties)
end
```


## Running A MQTT Service

This is the last example, we'll run a simple MQTT services on [Openresty][], please follow the guide in the
[020.web.md - Test Environment](./020.web.md#test-environment), also require the redis installed.


Now let's start the project.

```shell
cd ~
mkdir mqtt
cd mqtt
mkdir logs conf

git clone https://github.com/kurapica/PLoop
git clone https://github.com/kurapica/NgxLua

cd conf

vi nginx.conf
```

You can use vi or other to input this part into the nginx.conf(like use share folder for simple).

```conf
pid logs/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

stream {
    lua_package_path "${prefix}?.lua;${prefix}?/init.lua;/usr/local/openresty/lualib/?.lua;/usr/local/share/lua/5.1/?.lua;/usr/local/share/lua/5.1/?/init.lua";

    # no socket timeout error
    lua_socket_log_errors off;

    init_by_lua_block{
        -- The platform settings is very important to avoid problems
        PLOOP_PLATFORM_SETTINGS = { ENABLE_CONTEXT_FEATURES = true, THREAD_SAFE_ITERATOR = true }

        require "NgxLua" -- Load the PLoop & NgxLua
        import "NgxLua"  -- Import it to _G so we can use it directly
    }

    server {
        listen 1883;

        content_by_lua_block{
            -- Get the server-side client
            local client                = NgxLua.Net.MQTT.Client{
                MessageReceiveTimeout   = 3,
                ReceiveTimeout          = 1,
                SendTimeout             = 1,

                -- use redis message publisher
                MessagePublisher        = NgxLua.Net.MQTT.RedisMQTTPublisher{ host = "127.0.0.1", port = 6379 },
            }

            -- Process with the client
            client:Process()
        }
    }
}
```

Now we can run a client that subscribe a topic:

```lua
require "PLoop.System.Net.MQTT"

PLoop(function(_ENV)
    import "System.Net"
    import "System.Net.MQTT"

    local client = Client{ Address  = "127.0.0.1",  ProtocolLevel = 4, Port = 1883, ReceiveTimeout = 1, MessageReceiveTimeout = 1 }

    Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)
    Logger.Default.LogLevel = Logger.LogLevel.Info

    local ok, err = pcall(function()
        print("Connecting ...")
        if client:Connect() then
            print("Connection established")

            -- Don't forget use the method to catch the published messages
            function client:OnMessageReceived(topic, payload)
                print("[PAYLOAD]", payload)
            end

            client:Subscribe("/topic")

            client:Process()
        end
    end)

    print(err)
end)
```

And then a message producer:

```lua
require "PLoop.System.Net.MQTT"

PLoop(function(_ENV)
    import "System.Net"
    import "System.Net.MQTT"

    local client = Client{ Address  = "127.0.0.1",  ProtocolLevel = 4, Port = 1883 }

    Logger.Default:AddHandler(print)
    Logger.Default.LogLevel = Logger.LogLevel.Info

    local ok, err = pcall(function()
        print("Connecting ...")
        if client:Connect() then
            print("Connection established")

            for i = 1, 3 do
                print("Sleep 5 sec")
                client.Socket:Sleep(5)

                print("Publish message")
                client:Publish("/topic", [[{"station_name":"jiulonghu_1","real_data",[{"tag_desc":"liquid","value":"1.350"},{"tag_desc":"pressure","value":"3.600"}]], 1, true)

                local ptype, packet = client:ParsePacket()
                if ptype then
                    client:ProcessPacket(ptype, packet)
                end
            end

            client:DisConnect()
        end
    end)

    print(err)
end)
```

Run both file, the second will publish message uner "/topic", and the first will receive the published messages.



## Use WebSocket with MQTT

It's simple to use MQTT with the WebScoket, just modify the nginx.conf like :


```conf
pid logs/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    lua_package_path "${prefix}?.lua;${prefix}?/init.lua;/usr/local/openresty/lualib/?.lua;/usr/local/share/lua/5.1/?.lua;/usr/local/share/lua/5.1/?/init.lua";

    init_by_lua_block{
        -- The platform settings is very important to avoid problems
        PLOOP_PLATFORM_SETTINGS = { ENABLE_CONTEXT_FEATURES = true, THREAD_SAFE_ITERATOR = true }

        require "NgxLua" -- Load the PLoop & NgxLua
        import "NgxLua"  -- Import it to _G so we can use it directly
    }

    server {
        listen 9001;
        server_name  localhost;

        content_by_lua_block{
            -- Get the server-side client
            local client                = NgxLua.Net.MQTT.Client{
                -- Just use the WebScoket instead of the default
                Socket                  = NgxLua.Net.WebSocket(),
                MessageReceiveTimeout   = 3,
                ReceiveTimeout          = 1,
                SendTimeout             = 1,

                -- use redis message publisher
                MessagePublisher        = NgxLua.Net.MQTT.RedisMQTTPublisher{ host = "127.0.0.1", port = 6379 },
            }

            -- Process with the client
            client:Process()
        }
    }
}
```
